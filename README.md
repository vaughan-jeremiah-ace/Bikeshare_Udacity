### Date created:
file created 11/2/24

### Project Title:
Bikeshare_Udacity

### Description:
Created script to quickly analyze files from bikeshare.

### Files used:
To properly run the python script it requires 3 different datasources:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Issues to be aware of:
Currently the washington database does not have full customer demographics.


### Updates that need to be done:
This file currently works with csv files to generate data.
- Before putting into production will need to connect to actual datasource.
- Currently script only looks at 2017 data from Jan-Jun.
    - Will need to take into condsideration full year.
    - Also need need to expand for future growth.
